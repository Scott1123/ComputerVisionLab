## how to preprocess data 

- make a extractor (in c3d folder...)

- cd UCF_Crime dataset

- make list(get all videos list & train list & test list)

- make csv folders(C3D extractor cannot create them!)

- Main! extract all to csv

- Important, too. merge to txt(into 32 segments per video)

Then, the text files(fc6 features of videos) is ready!

start train!
