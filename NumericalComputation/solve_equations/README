This file implements four methods for solving equations,
including Gauss, LU decompose, chase, square root.


Files:
*solve_equations.py: the class EquationsSolver
*test.py: the main script to run


Run:
please use this command:
> python test.py
with default data(matrix A(100*100 dim) and x(100*1 dim) from 1 to 100)


Tips:
1. There are some prepared samples for different methods in function main().

2. if you use Gauss or LU decompose method, you can generate data by
> A, x, b = model.generate_data()

3. if you use chase method, you can generate data by
> A, x, b = model.generate_tridiagonal_matrix()

4. if you use square root method, you should make sure that matrix A is a symmetric positive definite matrix. Fortunately there is a prepared matrix A in main() and you can use it.
