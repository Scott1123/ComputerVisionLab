(Conjugate Gradient Method, QR Method.)
Author: Yang Lingyu

This file implements some methods for solving equations, including
Gauss, LU decompose, chase, square root,
Jacobi itration method, Gauss_Seidel itration method,
SOR method, Conjugate Gradient Method, QR method.

Files:
*equations_solver.py: the class EquationsSolver
*test.py: the main script to run


Run:
please use this command:
> python test.py
with default data(matrix A(100*100 dim) and b(100*1 dim))


Tips:
1. if you want to test different methods, just add them to *methods_list* at line 39 in test.py.

2. if you want to change the dimension of matrix A, you can modify *dim* at line 8 in test.py.
