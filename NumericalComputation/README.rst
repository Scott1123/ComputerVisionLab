Numerical Computation
-------------------------


This is a `solver`.

Implements some methods for solving equations, including
Gauss, LU decompose, chase, square root,
Jacobi itration method, Gauss_Seidel itration method,
SOR method, Conjugate Gradient Method, QR method.

**Files:**

* equations_solver.py: the class EquationsSolver
* test.py: the main script to run


**Run:**

please use this command:

>>> python test.py

with default data(matrix A(100*100 dim) and b(100*1 dim))


**Tips:**

- if you want to test different methods, just add them to *methods_list* at line 39 in test.py.
- if you want to change the dimension of matrix A, you can modify *dim* at line 8 in test.py.
