Numerical Computation
-------------------------


This is a *solver*.

Implements some methods for solving equations, including
Gauss, LU decompose, chase, square root,
Jacobi itration method, Gauss_Seidel itration method,
SOR method, Conjugate Gradient Method, QR method.

**Files:**

* equations_solver.py: some methods to solve equations.
* test.py: the main script to run


**Run:**

please use this command:

>>> python test.py

with default data(matrix A(100*100 dim) and b(100*1 dim))


**Tips:**

- if you want to test different methods, just add them to *methods_list* in test.py-main().
- if you want to change the dimension of matrix A, you can modify *n* in the front of test.py.
